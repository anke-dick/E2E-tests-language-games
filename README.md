# E2E-tests-language-games

This is a multi purpose repo in which I want to document on show how different 
testing frameworks work, how to get simple projects
like web apps and basic python rest services work,
and how to get a good grasp on E2E testing generally
and practically.

One first journey through this repo could be the path
through the 3 different approaches to test wiktionary in the browser
- robotframework: link to robotframework-README.md
- maestro: link to robotframework-README.md
- playwright: link to robotframework-README.md

after we have a dcent understanding of these 3 approaches we want
to create our own little example web app
first without backnd only as a set of statig htm pages
with some vanillaJS snippets and some fancy CSS

We want to explore different localisation strategies via resource keys
and diffeerent styling UI/UX approaches vis CSS

## How to install chromedriver for testing with robotframework selenium
and / or maestro desktop
