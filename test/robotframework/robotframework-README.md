# Robotframework example testing project

## Overview

### What is Robotframework?
A python based wrapper around other testing tools
like selenium for browser automation or appium for app automation
libraries to wrap rest calls for backend testing (system, integration, unit testing)

advantages:
- easy to understand and read language (gherkin style)
- helpful test reports
- screenshotting features included
- well maintained and widely used

I just like it because it makes testing and bug analysis easier than other
frameworks I know. Can be integrated and applied almost everywhere
and maintained by almost everybody with a basical technical understanding.

For more informations around robotframework look into the
[Robotframework user guide](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html)
